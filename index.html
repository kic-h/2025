            <p>Introducing knowledge into data-driven intelligent computing models to enhance their reliability and interpretability is an important way to achieve human-machine hybrid intelligence; Smart healthcare is an interdisciplinary field, which is a product of the cross fusion of various disciplines such as healthcare, informatics, knowledge engineering, computer science, intelligent computing, etc. The field of smart healthcare has high requirements for the interpretability of methods, and knowledge enhanced intelligent computing are perfectly matched with it. This workshop aims to provide a unique forum for experts in computer science, information science, healthcare and other interdisciplinary fields to gather for discussions on knowledge-enhanced intelligent computing in healthcare. Knowledge-enhanced intelligent computing in healthcare can improve the accuracy and reliability of AI-aided healthcare decision support, therefore, it can also hopefully provide insights to enhance the development of decision analytics in a broader sense.</p>
